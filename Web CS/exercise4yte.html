                    <p><b>The health and safety of the students are of our utmost importance. We seriously take care of the physical and emotional health of each member of the school community with the goals to enable students well-being, success for learning, and a balanced healthy lifestyle. Pennsylvania American International School has a well-equipped health center under the control of on-campus professionally qualified nurses and qualified counselors.

                    <p> The health center provides students with routine first aid and basic medical care throughout the regular school day from 7:30 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday.</p>
                    <p>The School Nurse makes sure to follow up on the health and the counselors offer the well-being service of all our students through health check-ups, vaccinations, and comprehensive counseling. Families are asked to submit a medical history form for each child registered at PennSchool. This is so our staff and full-time school nurse can better serve your child/children if they need help.</p>
            
                    <p>In the event of illness or injury to a student, the nurse will initiate first aid measures. In case of an injury requiring more than first aid attention, or for treatment of any conditions requiring a diagnosis, our school nurse contacts parents immediately and the student will be taken to the clinic chosen previously by parents for further treatment.</p>
            
                    <p> Our counselors work together with students, parents, faculty, staff, and outside community resources to provide a comprehensive counseling approach in the following areas:</p>
            
                    <p> <b>Individual counseling: </b> Students from Kindergarten to grade12 can meet with the counselors regarding adjustment, worries or feelings of anxiety, friendships or conflicts, identity issues, academic and career planning, personal goals, family crises, or to process any life events or feelings they are having.</p>
            
                    <p><b>Personal Education: </b>The counselors support classes that focus on social-emotional learning and personal growth.</p>
