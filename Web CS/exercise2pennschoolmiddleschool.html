                <li> <a href="https://pennschool.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Math_Standards1.pdf">Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for Mathematics </a></li>

                <li>Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) </li>
                <li>American Education Reaches Out (AERO) for Social Studies</li>

                <li>National Core Arts Standard for Performing Arts and Visual Art </li>
                 </ol>
            These set of challenging standards provide our students with a well-rounded education that balances high academic achievement with social and emotional growth. By embracing cross-curricular projects, collaboration, inquiry and the integration of technology into all areas of the curriculum, students mastery lifelong learning skills, such as research and communication skills, rather than mastery of a pre-ordained body of knowledge, our students are prepared for life beyond Middle School.
