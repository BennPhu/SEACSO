            From September 12th to 14th, the “House Olympics Day: Reignite the Eagle Spirit” sports event took place with the participation of students from the House of Aqua, Terra, Ignis, and Ventus. At the event, students engaged in various activities such as soccer, ball throwing, scavenger hunts, and tug-of-war, and proudly earned achievements for their respective Houses. The event fostered community spirit at PennSchool and developed sportsmanship along with essential soft skills like teamwork, discipline, time management, and leadership.

            Moreover, every member of #HomeOfTheEagles played a significant role in brightening the future for children in the highlands of Yen Bai and expressed hopes for global peace through meaningful activities on Peace Day and the PennSchool Autumn Night Moonfest. Specifically, with each student wearing a blue shirt on Peace Day and the proceeds from the Mid-Autumn Festival fair, the funds raised will be transferred to PennSchool’s “Light Up the Future” Community Fund to support the “Yen Bai, For a Brighter Tomorrow” community project in the academic year 2023 – 2024.

            In addition, students filled the letterbox “PEACE” with paper cranes, completed a giant, colorful mural, handcrafted friendship bracelets to exchange with classmates, and listened to podcasts about International Peace Day. Through these activities, students gained a deeper understanding of the significance and origins of Peace Day, realizing that every individual deserves equal treatment, respect, and love. This understanding has enabled them to build a safe, friendly learning environment and make meaningful contributions to society.

            Every full moon of this month, the PennSchool community gathers together to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival, one of Vietnam’s important cultural holidays, featuring traditional folk games. Taking place on September 28th and 29th under the theme “Pennschool’s Autumn Night Moonfest,” the Primary students of #HomeOfTheEagles will have an amazing time joining costume parades, lantern processions, watching lunar-themed festival performances, creating handmade gifts, and enjoying traditional foods. The High school students will also have their share of excitement with activities such as making mooncakes, performing lunar-themed plays, and personally decorating games and food stalls in their classrooms.
<br>
            It is certain that through the School’s regular events, #HomeOfTheEagles will become more connected, acquire valuable knowledge and skills, and develop lifelong qualities and a strong commitment to learning.
